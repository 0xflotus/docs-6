Logux is a new way to connect client (webapp, mobile app) and server.
Instead of sending HTTP requests (e.g. AJAX, REST, and GraphQL)
it synchronizes log of operations between client, server, and other clients
through WebSocket.

* Built-in **optimistic UI** will improve UI performance.
* Built-in **live updates** allow to build collaborative tools
  (like Google Docs).
* Built-in **offline-first** will improve UX on unstable connection.
  It is useful from next billion users to New York subway.
* Compatible with modern stack: **Redux** API,
  works with **any back-end language** and **any database**.
